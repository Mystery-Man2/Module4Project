I have completed the final project for Module 4. 

I have completed each section, naming them "Index", "Events", "Location", "Menu", and "Contact" respectively. 

I have added both ".html" and ".css" files for each page. 

I did not put them in their own respective filders because when i would do that in "VSCode", they would not function properly. 

I apologize for the unorganized mess that they are....they aren't the most beautiful, but I believe they meet the requirements of the project. 

This project really pushed me, and i enjoyed it greatly, i am excited to learn more about frontend programming!
